'High' level questions that should be answered:
Customer Preference- What types of cars do customers prefer/buy the most? What factors influence the choice of cars by customers? What are the profiles of buyers/customers for different types of cars?

Customer demographics: All but one age group by sedans, the only exception is people aged 50-60 who prefer to buy SUVs. Customers aged 30-39 purchase all 3 car makes (only them do this).
                      Salaried Customers buy more Cars than Business customers across the 3 car makes.
                      Hatchbacks are the most popular cars for Male, while Females prefer Sedans.

Income and Purchases: Households with higher Incomes prefer more exensive cars i.e SUVs. Lower earners prefer Hatchbacks.

Loan and Financing: Customers with personal and house loans purchase more Hatchbacks, followed by Sedans.
                    Customers with personal loan and a lower average household salary (~ 78,000) tend to buy lower-priced cars (~34,500 average).

Car Price Trends: SUVs > Sedans >, in decreasing order of pricing. Higher income households purchase expensive cars with average car price of about 59,300. Lower income households with average salary of 72,600 purchase cars with average price of 25,500.

Marital Status and Family: Single customers are more likely to buy Hatchbacks. Hatchbacks is the best selling and this is also true for Married customers.
                          Customers with working partners are more likely to buy Hatchbacks.
                          Our best customers are those with 3 or 2 dependents.
