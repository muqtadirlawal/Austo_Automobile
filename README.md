## Business Problem
Austo, a UK-based automobile company, aims to expand its presence into the US market after successfully establishing its business in Europe. The company seeks to understand the preferences and purchasing behavior of US car buyers in order to adapt its strategy to this new market. To do so, Austo has contracted a consulting firm to conduct market research and collect buyer data, which will be analyzed to identify trends and customer profiles for different types of cars.

## Rationale for the Project
The US automobile market presents a significant growth opportunity for Austo. However, to succeed in this new market, it's crucial to understand local customer preferences and purchasing behavior. This project will provide valuable insights to guide Austo's business strategy and production planning, ensuring they meet specific demand levels and identify new purchase opportunities.

## Aim of the Project
The project aims to:

- Analyze the car-buying preferences of US customers based on various demographic and financial factors.
- Create customer profiles for different types of cars (Hatchback, Sedan, SUV) to identify new purchase opportunities.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to help Austo adjust its business strategy and production plans to better meet US market demand.

## Data Description

- Age: Age of the customer.
- Gender: Gender of the customer.

### Overview
![](Overview.png)
This page provides a high level summary of actionable insights that management can act on at a glance.
- First, we see that Hatchbacks are the most popular Car Make, accounting for almost 56% market share of the 1,581 cars sold.
- Also, the average household income of the customers who bought these cars is $79,450.
- On the average, the customers are young adults aged 32 years.
- We see that the 22-29 age group make up the largest share of Hatchback buyers, showing the relevance of this demographic in driving Hatchback and overall sales. The 30-39 age group have a strong preference for Sedans.
- For families with 2 and 3 dependents, we observe that the overwhelming favourite is Hatchbacks, followed by Sedans. This suggests that young families that are just starting out prefer 'smaller' cars. For customers with 1 dependent, their clear favourite is Sedans while those with 4 dependents lean towards SUVs.
- Although there is no noticable difference in the preference of Hatchbacks between customers who are business owners and professionals who earn salaries, we see that customers who earn salaries buy more Sedans and SUVs than those who are business owners.

'High' level questions that should be answered:
Customer Preference- What types of cars do customers prefer/buy the most? What factors influence the choice of cars by customers? What are the profiles of buyers/customers for different types of cars?

Customer demographics: All but one age group by sedans, the only exception is people aged 50-60 who prefer to buy SUVs. Customers aged 30-39 purchase all 3 car makes (only them do this).
                      Salaried Customers buy more Cars than Business customers across the 3 car makes.
                      Hatchbacks are the most popular cars for Male, while Females prefer Sedans.

Income and Purchases: Households with higher Incomes prefer more exensive cars i.e SUVs. Lower earners prefer Hatchbacks.

Loan and Financing: Customers with personal and house loans purchase more Hatchbacks, followed by Sedans.
                    Customers with personal loan and a lower average household salary (~ 78,000) tend to buy lower-priced cars (~34,500 average).

Car Price Trends: SUVs > Sedans >, in decreasing order of pricing. Higher income households purchase expensive cars with average car price of about 59,300. Lower income households with average salary of 72,600 purchase cars with average price of 25,500.

Marital Status and Family: Single customers are more likely to buy Hatchbacks. Hatchbacks is the best selling and this is also true for Married customers.
                          Customers with working partners are more likely to buy Hatchbacks.
                          Our best customers are those with 3 or 2 dependents.
